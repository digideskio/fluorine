# Getting Started

There isn't a lot to learn for Fluorine if you've
worked with Redux and RxJS before.

It is not necessary to have worked with Flux and/or
Redux before, but unfortunately you should know your
way around RxJS.

[There is a small collection of learning resources for RxJS here.](rxjs.md)
