# Concepts

This chapter describes every major part of Fluorine's structure, ideas, and
concepts while providing brief examples for each pattern so you can apply
them yourself.

As much as possible, Fluorine tries to be lightweight and encourage good
patterns. If it gets in your way, post an issue!
