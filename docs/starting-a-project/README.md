# Starting a Project

This chapter will guide you through the steps to setup a project with
Fluorine. This might be a new React project, an old one that is missing
some state, or one that is already set up with Flux or Redux that you want
to migrate.

It tries to be as general as possible to accommodate for any structure,
that you've already set up. Please post an issue if you encounter any
problems!
