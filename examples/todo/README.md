# TODO

This is a very simple TodoMVC example, that is not particularly "Fluorine"-like, but
a direct migration from a Redux code base. This shows you how your project could look
after directly migrating it to Fluorine.

## Install

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
$ npm run start

> todo@0.1.0 start /Users/rgbkrk/code/philpl/fluorine/examples/todo
> node server.js

☕️  Server is listening on localhost:8000.
